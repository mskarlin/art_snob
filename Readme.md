# Art Snob infrastructure

## Art Snob scraping
Scraping is where we mine the raw data that we'll eventually mold into valuable recommendations for the users. Since 
we don't already have a large repository of artwork at our fingertips, we'll look to the internet to find the best
artwork among some popular sources.
